## IoT Smart Room Project

This project demonstrates how to use the ESP32 microcontroller to build a smart room controller. The controller can be used to control various devices in the room, such as lights, fans, and air conditioners. It can also be used to collect data from sensors, such as temperature and humidity sensors.

The controller is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi, which allows it to be controlled remotely using a mobile app or web interface. The app and web interface allow users to view the status of the devices in the room, turn them on and off, and set schedules.

The controller also uses a cloud platform to store data collected from the sensors. This data can be used to monitor the conditions in the room and to create automated rules. For example, the controller could be programmed to turn on the fan when the temperature gets too high.

### Hardware Components

The following hardware components are required for this project:

* ESP32 microcontroller
* Relay board
* Temperature sensor
* Humidity sensor
* LED lights
* Breadboard
* Jumper wires

### Software Components

The following software components are required for this project:

* Arduino IDE
* Visual Studio code
* ESP32 IDF
* Cloud platform account

### Instructions

To build the smart room controller, follow these steps:

1. Connect the ESP32 microcontroller to the relay board.
2. Connect the temperature sensor and humidity sensor to the ESP32 microcontroller.
3. Connect the LED lights, fan, and air conditioner to the relay board.
4. Upload the firmware to the ESP32 microcontroller.
5. Connect the ESP32 microcontroller to the cloud platform.
6. Create a mobile app or web interface to control the smart room controller.

### Example Use Cases

The smart room controller can be used to automate a variety of tasks, such as:

* Turning on the lights when someone enters the room
* Turning off the lights when no one is in the room
* Turning on the air conditioner when the humidity gets too high
* Setting a schedule for the lights and fan
* Sending an alert when the temperature or humidity gets too high

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use the ESP32 microcontroller to build a smart room controller. The controller can be used to control various devices in the room and to collect data from sensors. The data can be used to monitor the conditions in the room and to create automated rules.
