##  IoT Summer Training

This repository contains the code and documentation for the projects I completed during my IoT summer training program in 2023. The projects cover a variety of topics, including:

* Setting up and configuring a ESP32
* Connecting and programming sensors and actuators
* Using cloud computing platforms to store and analyze data
* Building web and mobile applications to interact with IoT devices

The projects are designed to be educational and practical, and they can be used by students, hobbyists, and professionals alike.

Here are some of the specific projects that are included in the repository:

* Smart home controller: This project uses a ESP32 to control various devices in a smart home, such as lights, thermostats, and door locks.
* Weather station: This project uses a ESP32 and various sensors to collect and display weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
* Security system: This project uses a ESP32 and various sensors to detect and alert homeowners of potential security threats, such as break-ins and fires.
* Industrial automation system: This project uses a ESP32 to control and monitor industrial equipment, such as motors and pumps.
